Agent: Thank you. And are you using the application in your cell phone or a reader?
Caller: A cell phone.
Agent: Okay. We are going to retrieve some information from the system so we can identify what could have happened. Could you please open the app in your cell phone?
Caller: From the app? Okay.
Agent: Yes.
Caller: Do you need me to open it?
Agent: Sure. Take your time. Thank you.
Caller: Okay. I'm in the app. Where do I go?
Agent: Okay. Firstly, I would like to know what type of cell phone are you using? Is it an iPhone or an Android?
Caller: iPhone.
Agent: iPhone. Okay. And just to guide you better, in the top left corner of the screen you will find three lines, which is the menu button. Press it, please.
Caller: Yes. Okay.
Agent: Okay. Perfect. And when you press it on the menu displays, please select the option About, which is the very last one in the menu.
Caller: Yeah. Okay.
Caller: Okay. I'm there.
Agent: And from the About screen, we are going to retrieve the following. Firstly, may I know the software full version number?
Caller: 3.6.4.1258.
Agent: Thank you. And the OS version?
Caller: 1.8.5.
Agent: Thank you. And just to make sure where it says country, it's showing United States, correct?
Caller: That's right.
Agent: Thank you. There is a section in there, too, that says last three sensors. From there, we are going to retrieve the serial numbers. I will need the first two that are listed, and they usually begin with 0H or 0J, for example.
Caller: Okay. Maybe I'll go for that. If you knew the I number you're looking for?
Agent: No, it's on that same screen. It says last three sensors.
Caller: Last three sensors.
Agent: Yes.
Caller: It says software release version 3, software version 4.01, 003, 5759, 9817, 008. That's what you're looking for?
Agent: There should be a section that says last three sensors itself.
Caller: Okay.
Caller: Yes. Let me go with that.
Caller: Yes. The first one is 0H, 003, 5759, 9817, 008.
Agent: Okay.
